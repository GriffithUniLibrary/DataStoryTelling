*"Data is the new oil" - Clive Humby, Data science innovator*

Nowadays, more information created than our audience could possibly analyse on their own! A study by Stanford professor Chip Heath found that during the recall of speeches, 63% of people remember stories and how they made them feel, but only 5% remember a single statistic. So, you should convert your insights and discovery from data into stories to share with non-experts with a language they understand. But how?


This tutorial helps you construct stories that incite an emotional response and create meaning and understanding for the audience by applying data storytelling techniques. Let's dive in!
