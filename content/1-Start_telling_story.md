How can you start telling your story? Too often data storytelling is interpreted as just visualising data effectively, however, it is much more than just creating visually-appealing data charts. 

## What you need to think

Your planning can start by thinking:

### Visuals
Think beyond the standard line or bar graphs
### Audience
So you can craft a story or a message for them.
### Story you want to tell
Building a narrative around your data can help you focus on what you really want to say

## What you need to do
### Storyboard your ideas
You have to get the actual message together before you can tell a story.  

### Refine by de-cluttering
It can help you articulate the impact of your story.
