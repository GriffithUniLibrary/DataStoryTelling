`workshop-template-b` is a Jekyll project to create a simple workshop website, with a [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)-based theme, designed for hosting on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

It works best for about 5 pages of instructions, plus index, all written in Markdown. 
The navigation to the main pages is exposed at top and bottom of each page for easy stepping through the lessons.

## What you need to think

Data storytelling is a combunation of data, visuals and narrative. So, your planning can start by thinking:

### Visuals
Think beyond the standard line or bar graphs
### Audience
So you can craft a story or a message for them.
### Story you want to tell
Building a narrative around your data can help you focus on what you really want to say

## What you need to do
### Storyboard your ideas
You have to get the actual message together before you can tell a story.  

### Refine by de-cluttering
It can help you articulate the impact of your story.
