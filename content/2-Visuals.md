We now explore some examples of visualisations. Be aware there are so many possibilities out there for visualising your data. Think beyond the standard line or bar graphs!

### Visualise your thesis
[Visualise Your Thesis](https://library.unimelb.edu.au/research/visualise-your-thesis#resources) is an international competition run by the University of Melbourne that challenges Higher Degree by Research (HDR) students to summarise their research in an engaging, 60-second visual presentation using a supplied template, that encapsulates your research project. It gives you the opportunity to build essential digital communication skills so you can effectively communicate complex research to a general audience. Competition submissions are judged on their visual impact, and how well the content presents the research. The competition allows for multi-media, interactivity and interpretation and is suitable for all disciplines. The video here is from a 2019 winner, HDR student at UTS.

### Video timelapse
You can highlight that time lapses would work well for event set ups, constructing buildings, or use of infrastructure throughout a day. This Pea Shoot video is very peaceful and therapeutic.

### Google Earth Timelapse
[Google Earth Timelapse](https://earthengine.google.com/timelapse/) is a global, zoomable video that lets you see how the Earth has changed.

### Interactive graphs
- This [New York Times' swing history graph](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/10/15/us/politics/swing-history.html) really impressess audience.

## Make sure your point can be seen
There are amazing and pretty looking visualisations, but, some visualisations may not be so clear that viewers can be confused and get lost.
Here are some examples with before and after:
