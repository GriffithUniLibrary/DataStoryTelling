In this section, we explore the power of story. 
Story is a very powerful stuff - it gets people together.
How do you develop your story? There are a couple of hits:

## Frame your ideas with your audience's view
Facts and evidence rarely help as people tend to reject any information or facts that counter their beliefs. So, data has to be in a context. People remember how a story makes them feel. It is important to know your audience and frame your idea to align with their values/views.

### Tell a story for a wider and non-specialised audience
You can see beutiful summaries of scientific findings in [Useful Science](https://www.usefulscience.org/). The aim of the site is to make science useful in daily life by telling  a new discovery in 5 seconds' reading to wider and non-specifice audience.

### Biases to be aware of - Confirmation bias
"We give special weight to information that allows us to come to the conclusion we want to reach." We tend to cherry-pick information that confirms our existing beliefs or ideas.

#### How to challenge bias?
If possible, get some background understanding of your audience. What would their current perception be, or potential concerns around the topic of interest? Can you approach your topic from a different direction?
For example, if you have someone that isn’t that interested in the environment, and thinks that environmental laws cost too much money for business, but you want to highlight climate change, talk about :

The rising cost of insurance due to more natural disasters, caused by the change in weather cycles
The financial benefit and potential profit of hosting electronic vehicle production in Australia or cheap maintenance on solar farms vs profit

#### Success story by Bono (U2)
Did you know that Bono was a strong advocate of AIDS support? He reached out to the American evangelical community by framing the AIDS problem with christianity view and got their support. How? There is [a nice article](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/aids/interviews/bono.html) to read. 

### Activity time

- What is your research topic?
- Think how you explain your research to an expert in your field.
- Then, think how you explain your research to your non-expert friends.

## Structure your story
Craig Cormick says that “Knowing your audience and your communication objective is crucial, but if you can turn your message into a story, it has a much better chance of being accepted.” 
Narrative flow = Story (how it might be described in chronological order) + Plot (how the story is told)

### Storyboarding
A storyboard is a planning tool for visualising and organising ideas

A storyboard helps you:
- Define the parameters of a story within available resources and time
- Organize and focus a story
Figure out what medium to use for each part of the story
