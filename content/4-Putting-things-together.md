Every piece of information we learn is founded on something we have already learned before. Thus, layering information is critical. It is a tool you can use to guide your audience through a complex story. In data storytelling, we can achieve this by:
- Compounding builds in visualisation
- Sequencing different types of visualisations
- Drilling deeper into a single visualisaion

## Putting things together
Do you know Dr Ignaz Semmelweis? 
{% include figure.html img="DrSemmelweis.png" alt="Dr Semmelweis" caption="Dr Semmelweis" width="50%" %}

He was a medical doctor, who made a great discovery when he was working at Vienna Hospital. However, he did not communicate it well and had a sad ending of his career. A video below tells you in details together with lessons we can learn from him. He had a [Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignaz_Semmelweis), too.

### Lessons learnt from Dr Semmelweis story
1. Timeliness and Clarity
- He did not publish for 14 years
- His findings were not well communicated
2. Audience and the Curse of Knowledge
- His audience (Doctors) at the time were not used to being criticised
- Instead of concept sharing and patience, he went on the attack and threw insults at his critics
3. Narrative Evokes Emotion
- Failed to tell the story of his data- did not humanize his patients but treated them as numbers
- Provided numbers instead of impact
4. Power of Data Visualization
- Relied primarily on data tables
- Ignored the Visual effect of graphs

### Activity - How would you tell Dr Semmelwise's discovery?
If you were Dr Semmelweis, how would you storyboard your ideas and re-tell your story?

Things you may want to think are:
- What audience would you focus on?
- What angle would you use to appeal to your audience?
- What would be your call to action? - Not sure that I understand 'call to action"
- Develop a brief flow of ideas about how you would most logically convey the story.

## You are done!

That's it folks! We hope you enjoy telling your story about your research with data :)
